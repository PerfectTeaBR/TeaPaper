✨ "Oooh, a Paper!" - DreamsBakery Paper's fork for Minecraft Java Servers ;w;

DreamsBakery has a bunch of plugins for minecraft servers, but he don't have a "Optimization" for large Minecraft Servers. ;w;

**And the TeaPaper is free to use!** I like that many of the plugins and a bunch of other Minecraft Java stuff I made at PerfectTea can be used in other projects :3

## 🌐 Features
- TeaPaper's optimization;
- More random plugins;

## 😃 More bunch of random things
Ok, this repository will have a lot of Minecraft Java plugins, including [JustALowLatency](https://github.com/PerfectTeaBR/JustALowLatency) :3

### 🤔 Why random things?
I wanted to include a bunch of cool stuff besides TeaPaper because sometimes I think, "Wow, I don't just want one topic in this repository, I want more than just that!" And besides liking Minecraft, I LOVE the plugins and community servers for Minecraft. I look at them and think, "How did those servers even start?" So I just included all those cool things :D

And this repository has the **PaperMC API.** ;w;

> [!CAUTION]
> The TeaPaper are in a **BETA VERSION**, we can have some bugs :3
